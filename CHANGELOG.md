# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added — the core

- **Model × effort routing.** Fifteen kinds of work, each with a ladder of
  cells; all five effort levels used, each for its own purpose; Haiku without
  an effort; Fable only on a `#fable` tag or `--allow-approval`.
- **Classification:** rules that are right when they fire, then Haiku with a
  JSON schema and no tools; below 0.6 confidence, or on any failure, the
  default kind.
- **Escalation on evidence:** shallow work climbs effort, a wrong approach or a
  repeated answer changes model, a timeout retries once, a turn ceiling is
  raised once, a wrong task replans. A worker's pass needs verbatim evidence;
  `--verify` has the last word.
- **One-shot workers** via `claude -p`: per-attempt model, effort, turn and
  dollar ceilings; read-only kinds get no edit tools; exactly the selected MCP
  servers; launched in one directory and working in another; no session kept.
- **Isolation:** one git worktree per writing task; a passed task leaves one
  branch, a failed one leaves nothing.
- **Capabilities** from a user-level registry: always, per kind, or after a
  failure; a hint per capability goes into the worker's system prompt.
- **Memory** in one SQLite file: tasks, the messages coupled to them, every
  attempt (the reroute trace), and problems with the fixes tried — searchable
  across repositories, this one first. History raises where a kind starts.
- **Hooks:** a prompt is a task, a follow-up joins its turn, a bare "continue"
  folds into the turn it pushes, a matching dead end reaches the model before
  it starts. Hooks fail open and report what they swallowed.
- **`/orchestration`**, the one entry point; the `cauce` CLI for everything else.
