"""Does the diagnosis method help an unclear bug? (`locks.methods`, kind `debug-unclear`)

Real: one `claude -p` worker per run on a fresh copy of the memory bench's pricing engine
(`bench/memory/hard`) with one planted bug the request only describes by its symptom ("a cent
off, sometimes"). The arms are the same request with and without the diagnosis protocol locks
briefs `debug-unclear` workers with (`methods.METHODS["debug-unclear"].lines`). Right when the
carts `kinds.REFACTOR_CARTS` price exactly as the untouched engine does, the suite passes, and no
test was changed (the planted bug breaks the suite, so a worker cannot pass by editing it).
