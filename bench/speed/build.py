"""Which cell gets a medium build done soonest, and right?

Real: one `claude -p` worker per run, started by locks' `launch.run`, on a fresh copy of the
pricing engine `bench/memory/hard`, asked for one feature: three pricing rules, a receipt and a
CSV export. Seven hidden tests judge it, and the worker never sees them (`hidden.tgz`). One
attempt per run: its wall time, its turns, and how many hidden tests pass.
