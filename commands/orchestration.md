description: Hand a request to locks — it classifies it, picks the model and effort, runs it in an isolated worker, escalates on evidence and remembers what failed
argument-hint: <what you want done>
---

You are the main agent, and locks is how you hand off what earns a worker:
one-shot workers that `locks` launches, each with exactly the model, effort,
tools and capabilities its task needs, checked without trusting them, whose
reports come back instead of their reading.

Request: $ARGUMENTS

This is the core. `locks guide <topic>` prints the detail when you need it:
`when` (what earns a worker, splitting), `dispatch` (flags, permissions,
Node, worktrees, workspaces, the queue), `endings` (every status and what to
do), `orchestrator` (your role, routes, speed), `workflows`, `panels` (a
Workflow script of your own, and its findings as locks work), `loops` (goals
that run in rounds), `notes` (and compacting), `memory`, `relay`.

1. **Do it yourself when it fits in what this session already holds** — a
   question, a lookup a few searches settle, a small change in files you have
   read. A worker earns its cost when the work would fill this context with
   reading, has independent parts, must be checked by someone who did not
   write it (a feature, a refactor, a fix with its test), or should go on after
   this turn. A judgment that needs this conversation and changes nothing goes
   to Claude Code's own fork (`/subtask`, the Agent tool's `fork`), not to locks.
   An exhaustive read-only audit or a comparison of designs can be your own
   Workflow script when that tool is in your list (`locks guide panels`). A goal
   that repeats with no end of its own (keep finding leads, keep CI green) is a
   loop: propose one with `/locks:loop`, never run its rounds by hand.

2. **Size it before you send it.** One worker has one context and one turn
   budget; past that every turn re-reads everything, and that is where the
   money goes. Send one task per piece that can be built and checked apart,
   each with its own `--surface` (the folders it may write): pieces whose
   surfaces cannot touch run side by side, and a piece that builds on another
   goes `--after` it. Not sure how to cut it? `locks split "<request>"`
   proposes the pieces, and `--queue` starts them. A build of many items is
   refused before it starts (exit 5, `not started: this request is several
   tasks`): split it as it says; `--whole` only when it truly is one piece. A
   chain with a blind review is a workflow (`locks workflow run feature|bugfix
   "<goal>"`; `locks guide workflows`).

3. **Dispatch** with Bash, from the repository the work is in:

   ```bash
   locks run - --verify "<the command the repository's CI runs: npm test, not ng test>" <<'EOF'
   <the task, written so a stranger could do it>
   EOF
   ```

   The task goes in on stdin (`-`) through a **quoted** heredoc (`<<'EOF'`),
   never as a double-quoted argument: the shell runs backticks and `$(…)` in
   one before locks sees it, and the task starts with that text missing. The
   same for `locks queue add -`.

   `--verify` is the repository's own check, the same command its CI runs
   (`npm test`, `npm run lint`), never the tool behind it: a runner called
   directly skips what the script adds (coverage thresholds, a config), and
   the plan warns when it does. A worker's own claim of success is not
   evidence. Write the task in full: the worker gets the person's words, none
   of your reasoning. Run it in the background when it may take a while and
   read `task #N started` before saying it runs; never pipe it through `tail`
   or `grep`. Queue what can wait (`locks queue add`, or `--detach`). When the
   `mcp__locks__*` tools are in your list, use `queue`, `tasks`, `resume`,
   `recall` and `note` instead. If `locks` is not found, call
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/locks`; never do the work by hand because the
   command did not resolve. `--kind` takes only locks' kinds: `explore`,
   `review-routine`, `review-critical`, `plan`, `docs`, `test`, `ui`,
   `refactor`, `implement`, `feature`, `debug-repro`, `debug-unclear`; any
   other word is refused with this list, and leaving it out lets locks
   classify. More in `locks guide dispatch`.

4. **Decide on each ending, at once.** You are the orchestrator: every stop is
   yours to carry. Ask the person only for what only they can grant (a refused
   command's rule, a cell's approval, a merge), and on their yes run the line.
   Report the verdict the notice carries; never re-read the code, re-run the
   tests or diff the branch to confirm it.

   | The ending says | Do |
   |---|---|
   | `done`, on a branch | report the verdict; merge only on their word (`locks merge N …`, or `locks pr N`) |
   | `replan`, `split` | it is several pieces and kept its work: `locks split N`, then `--queue` |
   | `replan`, turns | outgrew its turns as one piece: locks resumed it once; again, split what is left |
   | `replan`, wrong task | rewrite or split it from the reason; never rerun it as is (its surfaces kept it from the cause: run the `locks resume N --surface …` its ending gives) |
   | `blocked`, permission | ask for the rule; on yes, the person runs the line it gives (`--keep` for every task here) |
   | `blocked`, `decision` (exit 4) | the work is done and kept; tell the person the point, then act on it |
   | `blocked`, `review` | read the blockers (`locks show N`); resume `--unattended`, or dismiss with why |
   | `blocked`, environment or network | fix or wait, then `locks resume N --unattended` |
   | `blocked`, `limit` | nothing: locks resumes it after the account's limit resets |
   | `needs_approval` | ask; on a yes, the person runs the resume with `--allow-approval` |
   | `failed` | report what each attempt found (`locks show N`); never redo it by hand |
   | other work changes the same files | merge one first, then the other; `locks merge N M --pr` does both as one draft |
   | problems that were already there | start the bugfix it offers `--after`, if worth it |
   | flaky tests | nothing to do; it is said, kept per repository and named in later briefs |
   | a CI job known not to apply | `locks ci quiet <job>`, once, on the person's word |

   A resume you start on your own carries `--unattended`. A resume that grants
   something (`--allow`, `--allow-approval`, `--keep`) is the person's to run:
   give them the line to type (`! locks resume N --allow "…"` in this prompt,
   or a terminal). Claude Code's own permission check refuses it from you as
   a change to your own permissions, and it is right to. A task that stops
   pauses its lane: deal with it, and `locks lanes --unpause <repo>` when the
   queued work does not depend on it; a queued task that waits for work it
   does not touch starts with `locks lanes --beside N`. What waits `--after` a task you dismiss
   leaves the queue with it and comes back to you. `locks stats --expensive`
   says which runs cost the most and why. Every status in `locks guide endings`.

5. **What the project knows.** Before rebuilding context from the code,
   `locks recall "<question>"`; keep a durable fact the person tells you with
   `locks note "<fact>" --topic <t>`. Before debugging, `locks memory search
   "<symptom>"`. Compacting is your call, on locks' advice (`locks guide
   notes`); to start fresh without losing the thread, `locks relay`, then the
   person types `/clear`.

Use only the commands `locks --help` lists; there is no `locks continue`.
