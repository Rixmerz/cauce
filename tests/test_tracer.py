FLOW = """Flow: find training material by its title
Capability: find material
Audience: learners
Starts at: the material screen
Steps the person takes:
  1. types a title
  2. reads the list

Success path
- WORKS: the search returns the file
- CORRECT: the file shows under its real name with a thumbnail

Failure paths
| Failure | WORKS (system behaviour) | CORRECT (what the person sees and how they recover) |
| Invalid input | 400 | the field says which character is not allowed |
| Network or server error | 503 | the screen says it could not search and offers to try again |
| No permission | 403 | the screen says who can give access |
| Empty data | 200 | the screen says what it is for and the first thing to do |

Runs: end to end through the interface, against a production-like system
Verified by: someone who did not build it
