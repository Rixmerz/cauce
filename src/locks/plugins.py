"""Neighbours a worker gets as capabilities: MCP servers the person installed as
Claude Code plugins, found where Claude Code keeps them.

A worker runs with `--strict-mcp-config`: a plugin's MCP server does not reach
it by itself. So, as livespec is, the ones locks knows are read from the
plugin cache (`<claude config>/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/`),
newest version first, or found on PATH, and handed over as capabilities with a
line on when to use them and the plugin's own skill to read first.

What is read is the person's: their installed plugins and their PATH. Never a
repository, which must not be able to add an MCP server by committing a file.
An entry of the same name in the person's `capabilities.json` wins, and
`locks config plugins off` leaves all of these out.

- `layout-inspector` measures a rendered page: for UI work, and for the next
  attempt after implementing work the checks rejected.
- `rastro` browses for an agent with a minimal view and a trace of every
  effect: for tests, and after UI work failed. It runs with its saved routines
  off (`--routines=off`) and behind `locks.mcp_guard`, which refuses browser
  profiles and routines, lets writes and uploads reach only localhost, and
  keeps every call in a session of its own: a worker nobody watches never acts
  with the person's logins.
