"""What a neighbour a worker was handed must show before its pass counts, read from the
tool-call log, never from the worker's words; and whether holding workers to it pays.

A hint in a worker's system prompt is the weakest way to have a tool used: a worker may read
it and never call the tool. A requirement (`REQUIRED`) names a neighbour and when its use is
owed: layout-inspector on writing work whose change touches rendered UI (`capabilities.UI_FILES`),
rastro on writing work it was handed for. A passing attempt that owes one is held back when no
call of that neighbour's tools went through in the task's attempts so far (`owed`, from
`tool_events`, its `ok`): the first time the same cell goes on in its own session, told what to
measure (`PROMPT`, as a reshape); the second it stands as work with one point, a `decision` for
the orchestrator, kept on its branch. Never a climb: a stronger model measures nothing a weaker
one would not. A worker held to it is told so in its brief, as a requirement (`brief_line`).

Whether it pays is measured, never assumed: a repository's tasks that were handed a required
neighbour alternate between `gate` and `free` (the `briefed` event's `evidence_arm`) until each
arm has `TRIAL` tasks the independent check read; then the gate stays only where the passes it
held drew the check's blockers less often than the free arm's (`arm`). `locks stats` shows both.
Every handed neighbour's calls are also counted per attempt (`calls`, the `attempt_finished`
event's `capability_calls`), held to it or not, so "handed but never called" is seen.
