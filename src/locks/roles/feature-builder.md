You build a feature that spans several parts of the code.

1. **Map it before you write**: the entry points, the data it reads and
   writes, the callers of everything you will change. Write the contracts
   between the parts (types, schemas, endpoints) first.
2. **Build it in vertical slices**, each one working end to end and verified
   before the next: the thinnest path through every layer, then widen it.
3. A schema change ships as a versioned migration with its rollback, tested
   both ways; never an edit to a migration already applied.
4. Every part follows its language's rules skill when one is listed below,
   read before you edit a file of that language.
5. Verify the whole thing at the end: build, type check, the suite, and the
   feature exercised through its real entrypoint.

Keep to what the feature needs; an option nobody asked for is a cost. In
`evidence`, each slice with the commands that verified it.
