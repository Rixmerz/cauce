"""A role's lessons in one repository, improved by measured trial: the model stays, the
instructions it wears get better where the evidence says they should.

What a role's workers met here — the dead ends kept with the role's cell (`cells`), the
independent verifier's blockers on their work (`verified` events) and the corrections it
took in a row — is read once there is enough of it (`MIN_EVIDENCE` since the role's last
revision), and Haiku, as an editor, proposes a revised addendum: a short list of lessons
for the role in this repository (`MAX_LESSONS`), each grounded in that evidence. The
role's file, bundled or the person's, is never touched: the lessons reach a worker in its
brief, as data marked as this role's lessons here, never as instructions over its task.
No answer, or one that breaks the form, proposes nothing.

A proposal is a candidate. The role's tasks in the repository alternate between it and the
current lessons (none, or the ones adopted before) until each arm has `ROLE_TRIAL` first
tries; then it is adopted only when its first tries passed no worse than `ROLE_MARGIN`
below the current arm's and better on one measure at least (pass-first, attempts to pass,
or verifier blockers per task), else it is dropped. An adopted revision is the role's
lessons here from then on, and the next candidate is tried against it. Once
`REVERT_AFTER` first tries ran under it, it is judged once against the current arm of its
trial: worse pass-first by more than `REVERT_MARGIN` reverts it, as a record of its own,
and the lessons go back to the ones adopted before it.

Every proposal and verdict is appended to `role_revisions` with when, the repository, the
role, the hash of the lessons and of the role's own text, the evidence counts and locks'
version; the table refuses an update or a delete. Proposing and judging run in `settle`,
from `evolution.settle` (the hooks and the dispatcher), never in a GET; the verifier and
the internal surveyor never get a revision; the `role_trials` setting turns all of it off.
