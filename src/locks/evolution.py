"""How locks evolves, and why: a snapshot a day of what its work measured, read
beside every change of a standard (`locks evolution`, the UI's Evolution).

Once a day — at the first ending of a new day in the person's time zone, from the
hooks or the dispatcher (`settle`), or when a person asks (`locks evolution
--snapshot`) — one row per repository and kind is appended for the tasks that
ended since the last snapshot: tasks and points done, velocity (points per hour of
wall time), what a point cost and took, how often the first attempt passed, how
often a task climbed, the points estimated beside the points realized, and
locks' version. The report reads a window of them: each metric's trend (the
older half of the snapshots against the newer), and every change of a standard
(`locks.standards`) with its rule, its evidence and its verdict, in plain
sentences. No model reads or writes any of it; `settle` and `snapshot` are the
only writers, and a GET is neither.
