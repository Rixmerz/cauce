"""Which session orchestrates a project, kept in its `.locks/` so the role is not lost.

The work a session sends reports to that session. When it closes, is cleared
or goes quiet, what it sent kept waiting on a board nobody read, and every stop
that a session could have decided showed as waiting on the person. A project
names one orchestrator in `.locks/orchestrator.json`:

    {"session": "<id>", "cwd": "...", "since": "...", "via": "sent work"}

The first session that sends work becomes it; another one takes it over by
claiming it (`locks orchestrator --claim`), by a relay from it, by a `/clear` in
its place, or by sending work once it has not been seen for `STALE_HOURS`. A
take-over moves the work the old one sent, open or ended unheard, to the new
one (`Store.hand_over`), and so does the orchestrator adopting what a quiet
session left. What a stop needs from the person (`stops.for_person`) still
goes to the person: the orchestrator decides the rest.

Standard library only: the hooks read it on every turn.
