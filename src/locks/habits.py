"""Habits: repeated tool sequences, mined, and turned into automation only with a person's say.

The idea is muscle-memory's; the code is locks'. Every tool call is recorded
as a **signature** — the verb and the kind of thing it acted on, `bash:pytest`,
`edit:.py` — plus a hash of its arguments. Never the arguments, the file
contents, the output or the prompt: the miner needs to know *that* the
formatter ran after a Python edit, not what was in either. A last hard filter
keeps the signature to `[a-z0-9:._-]`, so a case the scrubbing missed still
cannot carry a path or a secret.

From those records:

- **candidates** — sequences that repeat *and could run on their own*: they
  start with an edit or a write and end in a command that does something (a
  formatter, a linter, tests, a build). The model looking around — `find → ls`,
  `cat → cd` — repeats in every session and is no habit: a hook could not take
  it over or save a turn. Gates are boolean (automatable, enough occurrences,
  in enough sessions, nearly always succeeding, nothing destructive); the score
  only ranks what passed them. A large count must never buy its way past a gate.
- **recipes** — per kind of task, the sequences that came before a worker's
  pass. They go into the next worker's brief: the steps that worked here last
  time, so it does not spend turns rediscovering them.
- **automation** — a candidate becomes a `PostToolUse` hook only when a person
  runs `locks habits install` with the command to run. Nothing in locks
  installs one by itself. An installed habit that fails three times in a row
  turns itself off, and `locks habits uninstall` removes it.
