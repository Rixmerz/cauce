"""A guard between a worker and an MCP server: the calls a worker nobody watches
must not make are refused here, not only asked of it in its prompt.

    python -m locks.mcp_guard rastro -- rastro mcp --routines=off

It runs the server as a child and passes JSON-RPC lines both ways (MCP over
stdio is one JSON message per line). A `tools/call` the policy refuses never
reaches the server: the worker gets a tool error saying why. Everything else
passes unchanged. Standard library only, and no import of the rest of locks:
it starts inside every worker that is handed the server.

The `rastro` policy keeps a worker to the app its task runs:

- a browser profile is refused: it holds the person's logins;
- writes and uploads are let through only to loopback hosts (localhost,
  127.x, ::1): the app under test, never a real site;
- saved routines and the profile list are refused: a routine can write with
  the person's logins;
- every call runs in rastro's session `locks-worker`, so a worker never picks
  up a session of the person's, with what it was bound to.

The `engram` policy keeps a worker to reading its own project's memory:

- only engram's reading tools pass: a save, an update, a delete, a judgment or
  a session call never reaches the store (what a worker learned reaches engram
  through locks, after a pass);
- every call is held to the project locks resolved (`ENGRAM_PROJECT`): another
  project, every project, and personal scope (which reads across projects) are
  refused.

The `livespec` policy keeps a worker to reading the code index:

- only livespec's reading tools pass: indexing, linking, syncing or exporting specs, creating,
  updating or deleting one never reaches the index (a tool's own `readOnlyHint` is not trusted:
  `export_openspec` carries it and writes files), so the independent check that is handed the
  index can look at the change and touch nothing.

The `outbound` policy holds the tools that act on the world (a capability lists
them under `outbound`) to the loop the worker's task is a round of
(`locks.loops`), read from the person's locks home at each call:

- outside a loop, or in a loop that is a draft, an acting call is refused: the
  worker writes what it would send instead;
- in a loop the person set to act, a call is refused outside the loop's hours,
  past its cap of acting calls an hour (across all its workers, counted in the
  loop's own log, which keeps when and which tool, never the arguments), or
  when its arguments name something the loop excludes;
- every other tool of the server passes unchanged.
