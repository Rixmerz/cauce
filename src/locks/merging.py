"""Merging the branches locks kept into the person's checkout, on their word (`locks merge`).

A task keeps its work on `locks/task-N` and the person merges it. Several kept branches at
once are where the work meets: two that change the same file conflict when the second goes
in. `locks merge 12 13 14` merges them into the branch checked out, one at a time, in an
order that puts the ones that touch no other first, and runs the check after each when one
is given. A conflict is aborted, never resolved by guess: the merge stops there, says the
files, and gives the task that would reconcile them. A check that fails after a merge stops
there too, with the merge in place and the line that undoes it.

Nothing here runs without the person's command; it never pushes, and it never rewrites a
commit that is already there.
