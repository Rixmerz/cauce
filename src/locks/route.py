"""Which way a request is done: by the session itself, by one worker, or in parts side by side.

locks started by sending work to workers. A worker costs a plan, a worktree, a
cold start on the code and, for a risky change, a verifier: for a small edit
the session that already holds the code does it faster, and a single strong
session is what most work wants. A worker earns its cost when the work is long
enough to run while the session goes on, or when the session's context is worth
protecting; parts earn theirs when the work splits into pieces that run at
once. `choose` reads the request with no model (its kind by rules, its size and
risk by the plan's own estimate, its listed items, the files and areas it names)
and the session's context, and says which, with its reasons. It is advice to the
orchestrating session, which decides; each decision is kept (`routed`) so the
choice can be measured against how the work went.

Standard library only, no model: the prompt hook runs it.
