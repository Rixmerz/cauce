"""Methods a worker is briefed to follow, each tried against its absence before it stays.

A method is a few lines of how to work that a kind's workers get in their brief: a diagnosis
protocol for `debug-unclear` (reproduce, where it fails and where it does not, why until a cause
that can be shown, then the fix), and a pre-mortem for `plan` (how the plan could fail and how
each failure would show). Both come from long-standing problem-solving practice (Is/Is-Not,
Five Whys, failure mode analysis); no text is taken from anyone.

Whether one helps is measured, never assumed: a repository's tasks of its kind alternate
between `with` and `without` it (the `briefed` event's `method_arm`, `<method>:<arm>`) until
each arm has `TRIAL` tasks, then it stays only where its arm did no worse (`arm`). A diagnosis is
judged by its own first tries; a pre-mortem by the first tries of the steps that came after the
plan in its workflow run, since a plan's own pass is its answer. A pre-mortem's risks also reach
the independent check of those later steps as where to probe (`risks`), data and never findings.
