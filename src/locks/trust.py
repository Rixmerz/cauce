"""Earned trust: what the independent check's record says of a cell, and how far it lets locks
look less and start cheaper.

A cell here is a repository, a kind and the cell a worker ran on. Each task's first independent
check of its work is one inspection (a lot, in acceptance sampling's words): clean, or blocked by a
problem the change caused. A correction's re-check is no new lot, and a check that could not decide
says nothing.

Sampling (`sampling`) is skip-lot sampling (ISO 2859-3): every pass is checked until `QUALIFY`
inspections in a row came clean; then one in two, and after another `QUALIFY` clean ones, one in
`EVERY[-1]`, never fewer. One blocker returns the cell to checking every pass, and it qualifies again
from zero. Only a change the verifier reads because a cheap cell made it (risk medium) is ever
sampled: a high risk is checked every time, and so are a fix of ledger rows, a correction's re-check
and a resume after a review stop (`orchestrate._sampled_out`). Which passes are checked is a hash of
the repository and the task, so a resume decides as its first run did and nothing is left to the
clock. A pass the sampling let through is a `verifier_sampled` event: its check said nothing, so it
neither qualifies a cell nor resets one, and locks' own check still ran on it.

The probation rung (`probation_arm`): a writing kind with a cheaper cell below its ladder
(`matrix.PROBATION`) tries it, in arms that alternate with the ladder's first rung, only where that
rung already passes `standards.PASS_FIRST` of its first tries here, and never on a high risk. The
trial's tries are first tries like any: `standards.calibrate` makes the cheaper cell the start only by
its own rule, and `standards.judge` reverts it when pass-first falls or a point that passed costs more
than on the rung it replaced.

What it says of learning (`report`): per cell, how often its checks came clean, where its sampling
stands, how many of its blockers repeat one an earlier task here already got, how often a
correction's re-check found something the round before had not, and pass-first and cost per point by
the cell a task started on. Read only, never by a model.
