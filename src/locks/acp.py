"""`locks acp`: locks as an Agent Client Protocol agent over stdio, for an editor
that speaks ACP (Zed's `agent_servers`).

ACP v1 is JSON-RPC 2.0, one JSON message per line. stdout carries only protocol
messages; anything else goes to stderr. Each `session/prompt` is one `locks run`
(or `locks tasks` / `locks stats` / `locks cancel N` for `/tasks`, `/stats` and
`/cancel N`) in the session's folder, its progress shown as one tool call and its
report as the answer. A `session/cancel` ends the turn at once, and the task goes on
for `CANCEL_WINDOW_S`: an editor sends it before the next prompt of a thread, so a
prompt that follows keeps the task running, and only a cancel nothing follows
cancels it. It is a way in, never a power: no `--allow`, `--allow-approval` or
`--keep` is passed, and the `mcpServers` a client sends are ignored, since the
servers a worker gets come from the person's own registry only. Standard library
only.
