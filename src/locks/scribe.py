"""What a session asked and established, kept as it goes: the scribe.

At the end of every turn the Stop hook reads what the session's transcript gained
since the last time and keeps the facts of the session in a small state file in
locks' home: the person's requests verbatim (and which of them corrected the
agent), the files the session wrote, the calls that failed and the call that
passed after them. No model reads or writes it. It is read from the transcript,
so it can leave things out to fit but never paraphrase; and it reads a file on
disk, so the session's own context is never touched. Nothing waits on a
compaction a person may never run.

What it keeps feeds three things:

- the brief of work the session sends (`context_for`): the part of the thread the
  task needs, verbatim, so a worker does not start from nothing;
- a relay (`relay_text`): a fresh session in the same place that starts from the
  thread, instead of a summary a model wrote from memory;
- the project's notes: every few turns (`notes_due`) a detached Haiku files what
  the conversation established, where it used to wait for a compaction or the end.

Stdlib only: the Stop hook runs it on every turn.
