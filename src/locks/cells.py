"""Where a lesson belongs: the area of the code it was learned in, the role that
learned it, or everyone.

A worker is shown what failed before only when it is its own: met in an area
its task touches, or by the role it wears. A failure two tasks met in areas
they have none of in common is shared: every worker may meet it again, and the
orchestrating session hears of it too. One met in a single area is that
area's: a security worker gets nothing from how a page's layout broke, and the
session that only delegates needs none of it.

A cell also keeps how its workers got oriented: what a passing worker says it
had to find before its first change (`orientation`) reaches the next worker of
its role or its areas as a primer, data and never instructions, so it does not
spend a third of its calls finding it again. Whether the primer earns its place
is measured, not assumed: a repository's tasks alternate with and without it
(`PRIMER_TRIAL` of each), then it stays only where it won (`primer_arm`).

An area is read from paths, no model: rendered UI (`capabilities.UI_FILES`),
tests, docs, and the areas a change can hurt (`risk`: data, security, money,
contract, delivery); a path none of them holds is `code`. A request's areas are
the ones its named paths fall in, and the ones its words are about.

The text a failure is kept and matched by is the work's own: a workflow step's
goal (its run's inputs), never the step's template, which every run of the
workflow shares word for word.
