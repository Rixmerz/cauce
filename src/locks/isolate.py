"""One git worktree per task, outside the repository.

A task that writes code runs in its own worktree on its own branch. The user's
checkout is never touched while the attempts run, and a task that passed leaves
exactly one branch to merge.

A task that stopped for a person — blocked on a refused command,
a cell that needs approval — keeps its branch too, marked unverified: the work
its workers did is real, and throwing it away is what made "I created the
routes" read as a lie when the files were nowhere. `locks resume` continues on
that branch. A task that failed or must be replanned leaves nothing behind.

Between attempts the worktree is reset only when the *approach* was wrong (the
next attempt is a different model starting over). When the work was shallow,
the next, more thorough attempt continues from what the last one left, because
that is the work it was asked to finish.

A worktree has only what git carries. The checkout's ignored dependency folders
(`node_modules`, a virtualenv) are linked in and the person's own
`.claude/settings.local.json` is copied in, so a build can run and the worker
is allowed — and refused — what the person set; both are taken out again
before anything is committed.
