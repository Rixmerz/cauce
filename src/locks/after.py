"""Work queued after other work: held until that work passes, then started on what it kept.

`locks run … --after <task>`, `locks queue add … --after <task>` and `locks
workflow run … --after <run>` queue work held behind a task or a workflow run.
The hold is kept in the queued task's options (`after`), and the dispatcher never
starts a task that holds one. A task or run that does not exist, or whose work
was dropped (it failed, it was cancelled, it was found wrong), is refused when
the work is queued, with its reason.

When the work it waits for passes, the engine releases what waits on it, where
it already advances a workflow (`workflows.advance`, at the end of
`orchestrate.run`; for a run, when its last step passes), in one write
transaction: each held task starts on the branch that work kept (a run's, its
last step's), or on the base when that branch is already merged into it, and its
plan says which. Nothing is merged or rebased. Work that stops short of a pass
releases nothing: what waits on it stays held and says why, until a resume of it
passes, or the person dismisses or cancels what waits. A chain is released one
link at a time: each link waits on the one before it, and on nothing else.

Work that leaves the board without passing takes what waits on it along
(`abandon`): a task dismissed, or a run cancelled, will never pass, so what is
held behind it leaves the queue too, cancelled by locks with why, and the session
that queued it hears of it as an ending. A task superseded by a later one with the
same text that passed hands what waits on it to that one (`hand_on`), and one
whose change already landed on the checkout's branch releases it onto the base.

Light: the dispatcher, its views and `stops` read it.
