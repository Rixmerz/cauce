"""Whether a task's check can run here at all, read before any worker is spent on it.

A check that cannot start (a program missing from the PATH it runs with, a script its
package.json lacks, a Node no installed one satisfies) fails after a worker already ran,
and says nothing about the work. The preflight reads the same command at plan time, in
the directory it will run in, with the PATH it will run with (`runtime.env_for`), and
names what would stop it with the exact line that fixes it. No model, no network, a few
file reads and at most one short process.

It fails open: what it cannot tell (a substitution, a `cd`, a workspace flag, a program
or script the request itself may add) is said, never a stop. Ports are not its business:
`locks.services` already leaves a port that answers alone and stops a task whose service
never listens.
