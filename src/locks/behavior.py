"""How a worker worked: one attempt's profile, read from its own tool calls, and the analysis's
table of those profiles by kind, outcome and cell.

The calls are the PostToolUse log's (`tool_events`, read into the store first): a tool, a
signature and whether it went through, never an argument. An argument's hash is only compared
with the attempt's other calls (a file read again, the same call repeated) and never kept here.
The independent check's calls are not the attempt's (`orchestrate._verifier_env`). Observed, never
a rule's input and never a trial; no model.
