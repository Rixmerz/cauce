"""When a session should compact, and what `/compact` should keep.

Claude Code compacts on its own when the context crosses a threshold: often in
the middle of work, and often after the prompt cache went cold, so the summary
request pays for the whole history again. locks sees better moments. At the end
of a turn the Stop hook asks `decide` whether now is one: the context is big
enough to be worth it, a natural break just happened (work this session sent
ended and was reported, a branch was merged), no run of this session holds the
checkout, the last turn ended while the cache is still warm, and nothing
compacted or was suggested within a cooldown. A decision worth keeping is a
`compaction_decided` event on the turn's task, with its reasons.

What `/compact` is told (`instructions`) is read from what locks already keeps
for a compaction — the scribe's thread, the session's tasks, git — never
written by a model, bounded to fit one line, secrets masked as the digest masks
them. Its marker (`MARKER`) names the decision: PreCompact's
`custom_instructions` show that a compaction was the one locks asked for, and a
text that reached the model as a message says itself that it is no request.

The orchestrating session decides (`orchestrator`, the default `compact`
setting): locks' moment reaches it as advice, with the reasons, and the session
compacts by calling the mod's `compact` tool when it judges the conversation's
detail is no longer needed — on that advice or on its own (`request`). What it
asks the summary to keep is quoted apart, marked as the session's; the rest of
the instructions are locks', read as below. The compaction it asked for runs
when its turn ends, as `auto`'s does.

The mod delivers it (`next_step`, the `compact` setting): `suggest` shows the
person the line, `auto` has the engine compact between turns with the same
instructions (`$.session.compact`, the call `/compact` makes; a `/` text a mod
submits is refused by the engine; a headless session, which has no such call,
gets `/compact` run with them, `$.command.run`, settled from the hooks as a
submit nobody answered). What it answered is kept (`compacted`); a
call that failed only shows the line (`delivered`), since a failure says nothing
of the build. The classic hooks also record each compaction they see (`seen`),
and `settle` decides from them a submit the mod never reported. The answer is
kept per Claude Code version in the locks home: a build found not to run one
gets the line shown from then on.

A compaction the session asked for may carry what it goes on with after it
(`then`, the session's own prompt to itself): with nothing of its work running,
no ending would ever start its next turn. Once the compaction finished (a hook
saw one end after the decision was delivered, or the mod settled it), `next_step`
hands that prompt to the mod once (`continuation`, a `compaction_continued`
event), quoted and marked as the session's own words, and the mod submits it.

Stdlib only, no model call: the Stop hook runs it.
