"""How many workers this machine runs at once, and how the lanes share them.

Horizontal scaling is the number of workers: this level. Vertical scaling is the
cell and the turns each task starts with and climbs by evidence (`matrix`,
`escalate`), and it is not decided here. Money moves neither: a costly ending is
as clean as a cheap one.

The level is kept per machine, in the cauce home (`capacity.json`), and moves the
way congestion control does. It starts at what the machine can hold: its CPUs,
its free memory (each worker counted at `WORKER_MEMORY_MB`) and the free disk
where worktrees live (`WORKTREE_DISK_MB` each), at least 1. It rises by one when
work waits for a worker and a round of tasks it started (as many as the level)
ended with no limit. It halves, never below 1, when an attempt says the API
turned it away (a rate limit or an overload, read from the CLI's own result,
never from a check's output), when the machine starved a worker (killed for
memory, a full disk), or when free memory or disk falls under its constant, or
the load average climbs over `LOAD_PER_CPU_HIGH` per CPU; after a rate limit it
does not rise again before the API's retry-after. A level the machine itself
lowered (memory, disk, load) goes back up as soon as the machine is clear again
(over `RECOVER_MARGIN` times its constants, the load under `LOAD_PER_CPU_CLEAR`)
for `RECOVER_AFTER_S` and work waits: freeing the disk brings the workers back
without waiting for a round of tasks to end. The person's
`max_parallel` caps it; `auto` puts no ceiling over it. Each change is a
`level_changed` event, on the task that caused it, or on task 0 when the machine
did.

The lanes share the level by reserve and lending. With level L and k lanes that
have work to run, each is reserved at least max(1, L // k) workers, granted in
the order their oldest work was queued while L lasts. A lane runs its reserve
first; what a lane does not use is lent, in the same order, to the lanes that
have more; a lent worker goes back to its lane as soon as that lane has work and
a borrowed task ends: nothing running is ever stopped to give it back. A lane
paused on a person reserves nothing, and its running work still holds its
workers.
