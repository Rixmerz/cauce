"""What the store says is broken: states cauce should never reach, read, never written.

Every rule here is a bug cauce shipped and found late, in real work, turned into a
query: a lane paused on a task that already passed, a workflow part that lost its mark
when it was resumed, an integrate step that joined fewer branches than its parts kept,
a worker whose death nobody resumed. A rule reads the store as it is (`broken`: work
is stuck now) or as it went over a window (`suspect`: something that should have
happened did not). No model, no write; `cauce doctor` prints them, the session start names
what is broken, and the scenario tests assert there is none. Two rules read more than the store:
the livespec index of each repository recent runs were in (opened read-only, with the last
commit's time), since a missing or stale index is a bug nothing in the store shows.

A `suspect` rule names the release that fixes its bug (`FIXED_IN`), and reads it only from
what that release or a later one wrote (the `version` an event keeps): the records from
before it are counted apart as `fixed`, so what it reports is the bug coming back, never
the history the fix is for.
