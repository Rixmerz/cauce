"""Claude Code hooks: every prompt becomes a task, and what is said about it stays with it.

- **UserPromptSubmit** — a new prompt is a new task. A message typed while a
  turn is running belongs to that turn's task, not to one of its own. A bare
  "continue" folds into the turn it pushes along. When the prompt matches a
  fix that already failed — here or in another repository — the dead end is
  put in front of the model before it starts; when it matches this project's
  notes, so are they.
- **Stop** — the turn's final message is the task's result. Any other task
  still running in the session belongs to a turn the user interrupted; Claude
  Code fires no Stop for those, so they are marked interrupted now. The scribe
  reads what the transcript gained (`cauce.scribe`) and, every few turns, has
  the project's notes filed.
- **StopFailure** — the turn died; its task failed.
- **SessionStart** — on resume or compaction, the unfinished tasks of the
  session; on a new session where a person left a relay (`cauce relay`), the
  thread of the session it continues; always, the recent dead ends of this
  repository and the index of its notes. When `cauce` does not resolve on PATH, it is put there for the
  session's commands.
- **PreCompact**, **SessionEnd** — a detached Haiku reads what the session
  said since the last time and keeps its durable facts in the project's notes,
  before the conversation is summarized away or closed.
- **Stop**, **PreCompact**, **PostCompact** — whether a turn that ended is a
  good moment to compact, and every compaction seen, for the mod to suggest or
  submit `/compact` and learn whether it ran (`cauce.compaction`).

Hooks fail open: an exception never reaches Claude Code, because a hook that
raises takes the user's session down. But failing open is not failing silently
— the error goes to a ledger, and the next SessionStart says it happened.
