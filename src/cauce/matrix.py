"""Model x effort: the two dimensions a task is routed on.

The **model** decides how well the work *notices* things — that a green test
pins a bug, that the spec is wrong, that the obvious fix is the one that
failed last week. The **effort** decides how *thorough* the same model is:
how much it thinks, how many tools it calls, whether it checks itself before
it says it is done. They are different dials, and a router that treats them as
one ladder spends the top tier on work that only needed a second look.

Every effort level has a purpose. None of them is a rung that exists only to
be climbed past:

  ==========  ===================================================================
  ``low``     Direct answers, few tool calls, no preamble. Chat, explanations,
              commit messages, trivial edits. It drops self-checks, which is fine
              where there is nothing to check and wrong anywhere else.
  ``medium``  Saving where quality holds. The starting point for agentic coding on
              Sonnet: implementing from a clear plan, tests, refactors, docs.
  ``high``    The floor for work that needs judgment: debugging with a repro, UI,
              integration, routine review. Usually the best balance.
  ``xhigh``   Most agentic coding and long-horizon work: a feature that crosses
              several parts, a bug with no clear cause, a hard plan.
  ``max``     Correctness over cost. Only where the level below showed headroom,
              or the change is critical.
  ==========  ===================================================================

Haiku has the dial since Haiku 5.5; a cell written without one (``haiku``, as
older runs recorded it) is Haiku at ``medium``, the model's own default. Fable is
reserved for work a person asked for.
