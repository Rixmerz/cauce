"""The Node a project declares, put first on a worker's PATH.

A worker inherits the PATH of whoever ran `cauce`, and with it whatever Node
was the default there. A project that needs another one sends the worker
hunting: `source nvm.sh`, `nvm use`, `~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.x/bin/node`,
`/opt/homebrew/bin/node` — each a different command, each refused, each a
new `--allow` to pass. So cauce reads the version the project declares —
`.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, or `engines.node` in `package.json` — finds it
among the versions nvm installed, and puts its `bin` first on the PATH of the
worker and of its `--verify` check. Nothing is installed or switched.

A project that declares nothing still has dependencies that do: a CLI that
refuses to start on an older Node says so in its own `engines.node`. When
the Node on the PATH fails what the installed dependencies require, cauce
puts one that meets them first instead, of the same major when one is
installed, so native modules built for it still load. When none installed
fits, the plan says which dependency needs what, before any money is spent.

Standard library only.
