"""Work that is waiting: the queue, its lanes, the dispatcher and the sweep.

A queued task costs nothing until it runs, and it runs in a worker — never in
the orchestrating session's context. Each repository is one lane. The first
task of an idle lane starts; one queued behind running work that will not write
(a reading kind, or text that says it changes nothing) starts beside it with no
question; any other starts beside it only when Haiku judged it independent of
all the writing work running and queued ahead (`dispatch.decide`, kept on the
task with its reason, `parallel` setting) — otherwise it waits its turn. A
task that ends in anything but a pass pauses
the lane, so nothing new starts on a state it may have left broken — unless a
person cancelled it, which is their call on that task, not on the queue. A
person unpauses it.

How many run at once is no number fixed here: it is the machine's level
(`cauce.capacity`), which adapts to the API and the machine and is shared between
the lanes by reserve and lending. Every dispatcher settles it, allots it and
claims what it starts under one lock.

Each dispatched task runs as its own `cauce run-queued` process: its pid is its
own, so the sweep and `cauce cancel` treat it like any other run, and the
dispatcher only watches.

The sweep is what keeps "running" honest. A `cauce run` that was killed leaves
its task marked running forever; the sweep checks the process, and a task whose
driver is gone becomes interrupted and pauses its lane. It runs from hooks, the
dispatcher and the UI server — never from a page being open.
