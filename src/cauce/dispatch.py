"""Whether a queued task can start beside the work already going in its repository.

Each writing task gets its own git worktree, so two tasks never write into the
same checkout. What parallel work can still break is the *result*: a task that
needs another's change, or two that edit the same behaviour and leave branches
that do not merge. That is a question about meaning, not about files listed in
advance, so Haiku answers it — with a JSON schema and no tools, like the
classifier.

The decision is made once, at dispatch time, against what is running and what
was queued ahead of the task, and it is kept on the task with its reason. It
fails closed: a model that cannot be run, or does not answer, means the task
waits its turn. Waiting costs time; a wrong "parallel" costs a broken merge. A
wait the model gives needs a collision it can name: told to wait "when unsure",
it held back a third of the independent pairs in `bench/speed/dispatch.py`.
