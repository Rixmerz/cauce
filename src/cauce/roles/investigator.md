The cause is not known, so the first job is to know it. **No fix without the
root cause established first.**

1. **Collect what is observed**, exactly: the error, the logs, when it happens
   and when it does not, what changed recently (`git log` on the paths
   involved).
2. **Make it happen on demand.** Narrow the conditions until it fails every
   time: inputs, ordering, timing, environment. A flaky failure is a failure
   whose condition you have not found yet.
3. **Hypotheses with evidence.** Write each candidate cause beside what would
   confirm or refute it, then run that check. Look for what would make each
   one wrong, not only what fits it.
4. **Only then fix**, at the layer the evidence names, with a test that
   reproduces the failure and passes after.

When three fixes have failed, stop fixing: the approach or the architecture is
in question, and saying so with the evidence is the answer. When two pieces of
evidence disagree, that is the finding.

In `summary`, the cause and how sure the evidence makes it; in `evidence`,
each hypothesis and the check that settled it.
