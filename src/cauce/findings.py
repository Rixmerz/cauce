"""Findings as records, not prose: where, what, how it is known, and whether
the change caused it.

A reviewer, an auditor and the independent verifier report each finding with
`evidence_class` (deterministic: a command, a test or a diff shows it;
inferential: read from the code; insufficient: suspected, not shown) and
`cause` (introduced or worsened by the change, pre-existing before it, or
unknown). A finding blocks a change only when the change is to blame (or it
cannot be told: unknown counts as to blame) and it is more than suspected.
Pre-existing problems are reported and never block.

Two findings are the same when they name the same place and say the same
thing; `key` is that identity, so a re-check can tell a finding it already
reported from a new one.
