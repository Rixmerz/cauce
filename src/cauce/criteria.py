"""What was asked, kept as asked: a request's items as numbered criteria.

A request that lists what it wants (bullets, numbered lines) becomes criteria
`S1..Sn`, each the person's own words, verbatim. Every worker and every check
reads the same words: a paraphrase loses the detail that decides a check. A
worker that claims a pass says, criterion by criterion, whether each is met
and what shows it; a pass that leaves one out, or says one is not met, is not
a pass.

A request in prose has no criteria: splitting sentences would invent
structure the person did not write. Items the request itself puts out of scope
— listed under a line like "Part B (do not touch):" or "Fuera de alcance:", or
marked so on their own line — are no criteria: a pass is never asked to meet
what the person said not to do. The brief names them as left out.
