"""The TRACER method in a repository that keeps it (`docs/tracer/`): read, never written.

TRACER (github.com/Rixmerz/tracer) defines a product from its audience's side before it is built:
audience profiles, critical flows whose acceptance lines come in two halves (WORKS, the technical
result; CORRECT, what the person sees and can do), component floors and a catalogue of UI/UX
anti-patterns. Its phases that need the person (the contract, the empathy round, the scope filter)
stay in the session; what cauce does is carry the written method into the work it runs:

- a writing worker gets the audience, the floors, the anti-patterns, the identity and the flows its
  request names, as data, in its brief;
- the independent verifier gets the CORRECT lines of those flows and the anti-pattern catalogue as
  what the change must meet: a line that does not hold, or an anti-pattern shown, is a finding.

Nothing here is a model call, and nothing is written in the repository.
