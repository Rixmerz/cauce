"""Adapters: neighbours the core adopts, instead of listing them as one more plugin.

A *capability* (see `cauce.capabilities`) is a server the core hands to a
worker: the worker may call it, and the core knows nothing about what it says.
An *adapter* is a neighbour the core understands. It reads the neighbour's own
data with the standard library — no tokens, no MCP call — and uses it at the
three moments the core decides something:

- **before routing** — signals that move where a task starts (a symbol half the
  codebase calls; code a critical spec depends on);
- **before the worker starts** — a briefing, so the worker opens with the map
  instead of spending its first turns searching for it;
- **after a pass** — what the change touched that the worker did not, which
  goes in the report a person reads before merging.

And it hands the worker the neighbour's server, with a hint per kind of work
naming the calls that kind needs.

An adapter must say what it could not tell. *Absent* (not installed, repo not
indexed) and *unreadable* (installed, but its data could not be read) are
different: the first is a fact, the second is cauce's or the neighbour's bug,
and neither may stop a run.
