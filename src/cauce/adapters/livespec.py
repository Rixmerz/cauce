"""livespec, adopted: the code index the core reads before it routes, briefs and reports.

livespec keeps its index in ``<repo>/.mcp-docs/docs.db`` (or a shared file
named by ``[workspace] group_db`` in ``.livespec.toml``): symbols, a call graph,
code chunks under full-text search, and the links between symbols and specs.
That file is readable with ``sqlite3`` in read-only mode, so the core uses it
without a token and without an MCP call:

- **routing** — a task whose code is linked to a critical spec, or whose
  symbol is called from everywhere, starts one rung up;
- **briefing** — the worker's prompt opens with a code map: the symbols the
  request is about, where they are, how many places call them, the specs they
  implement and the tests that exercise them;
- **reporting** — after a pass, which specs the change touched and which
  callers in other files the change did not touch;
- **freshness** — an index that is missing, or older than the last commit, is built or
  refreshed with livespec's own headless CLI (``livespec index``, incremental) before
  the worker starts, for as long as the person's ``livespec_wait`` allows
  (`Livespec.ensure_fresh`); never for a folder that is no repository, which is
  indexed through each repository inside it.

The worker also gets livespec's MCP server, with a hint per kind of work that
names the calls that kind needs and the ``workspace`` every call requires.

Checked against livespec 0.35.0. Every tool named here exists in that release;
`TOOLS` is the pinned list, and a test holds every hint to it.
