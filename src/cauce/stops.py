"""Why a task stopped short of a pass, who made that call, and what continues it.

A card that only says "blocked" asks a person to act without saying on what,
and "cancelled" does not say whether they did it. Every place that ends a task
without a pass — the run's own loop, `cauce cancel`, the UI, the dispatcher,
the sweep — writes one account on the task's `finished` event: the cause, who
or what made the call, the reason in full, and the command that continues it
when there is one.

Tasks that ended before these accounts existed get one read back from what
their events and attempts already say (`recovered`), marked as such: an
account cauce did not record is never presented as if it had.

Light on purpose: the UI, the hooks and the CLI read it.
