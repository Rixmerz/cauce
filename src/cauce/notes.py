"""What a project knows, by topic: notes, the links between them, and the code they are about.

The memory of problems and fixes is global on purpose: a dead end in one
repository is a dead end in the next. What a project *is* is not: its business
rules, why its code is shaped the way it is, how it is run. That knowledge is
kept per project, in notes, so a session that compacted or a worker that just
started reads it back instead of rebuilding it from the code.

A library, not a heap:

- **Topics.** Every note is filed under one topic of a closed set (`TOPICS`,
  plus the ones a person adds to a project). Haiku files a note under a topic
  that exists; when none fits it may propose one, and a person decides.
- **Links.** Notes point at each other with a kind (`LINKS`): a business rule
  `depends_on` another, a decision `explains` a piece of code, a new fact
  `replaces` an old one. Recall follows them one step.
- **Anchors.** A note can be about a file or a symbol, as livespec ties a spec
  to code. An anchor remembers the file's content when the note was written; a
  later commit that changes it marks the note `review`. A note nobody checks
  again does not get to lie quietly.

Notes are written at three moments, never whenever a model feels like it: a
worker that passed lists what it `learned` in its result block; before a
session compacts or ends, Haiku reads what was said since the last time; and a
person keeps one with `cauce note`. They are read back by topic, by the code a
task touches and by full-text search inside the project, never another one.

What a worker learned is a claim one pass made, not yet a fact: it starts as a
`candidate`, read back marked unproven, and the tasks whose brief carried it
decide (`weigh`, run when work settles, never in a GET): current after
`PROVE_AFTER` of them passed their first try, dropped after `DISPROVE_AFTER`
failed theirs with none passing. A person's note, and one Haiku filed from a
conversation, is current as it is written.

Haiku files, and fails closed: when it cannot run, a fact is still kept, under
the topic its words point to (`filed_by: rule`), with no links.
