"""How big a task is, on the scale people give tickets: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

Two readings, never by a model. The **estimate** is made when the task is
planned, from what the plan already knows: how many criteria the request lists,
its kind, its risk tier and the areas that raised it, the files and surfaces it
names, how many symbols livespec says it reaches (when the index is readable),
and its length, the weakest signal. The **realized** size is read when it ends,
from what git and the attempts measured: files and lines changed, turns, wall
time, attempts. Both are on the same scale, so the two can be compared.

Each signal adds a weight by named thresholds, and the sum lands on the scale;
every weight that counted is a reason, so "5: 4 criteria, touches schema, risk
high" says how it was reached. A standard per points band (`cauce.standards`)
is what the score is for: where a task of that size starts.
