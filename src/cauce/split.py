"""A request that is several tasks, as the pieces it splits into (`cauce split`).

A build too big for one worker's turns costs the most as one task: every turn re-reads
everything read so far, and the climb after it (more turns, a stronger model) pays that
again. `cauce run` refuses one before it starts (`route.split_first`), and a run stops one
that outgrew its turns as several pieces (cause `split`). Either way the orchestrator gets
the pieces from here instead of inventing them:

- a request that lists its items is split by them, with no model, each item a piece, the
  folders it names as its surfaces;
- prose is split by Haiku, read strictly as a plan's parts are (`launch.read_parts`: ids,
  prompts, surfaces no other piece reaches, `after` naming an earlier one); an answer that
  does not read gives no pieces, never a guess.

Nothing is queued unless asked (`--queue`): then each piece starts on what the task it
splits kept, the work queued after that task waits for the last piece, and the task leaves
the board, dismissed with the pieces' numbers.
