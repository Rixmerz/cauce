"""A workflow step whose first attempt forks the session of a reading step before it (its
`trunk`): what it forks, whether it does, the note that marks the role it takes from there,
and the trial that keeps forking only where it pays. stdlib; no model.

A trunk reads and decides nothing for the steps that fork it: it runs with no role in its
system prompt (its role goes in its brief), since Claude Code records a session's system
prompt on its first request and every resume and fork sends that record as it is
(`--system-prompt-snapshot`). A branch's role and its capabilities' hints therefore reach
it as its first message, after the fork point: the trunk's prefix stays the same for every
branch, and the prompt cache serves it to each one on the trunk's model.
