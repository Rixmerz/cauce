"""After a failed attempt: which way to move, if any.

A failure is evidence about *where* the problem lives, and each place has one
right response. Conflating them is how an orchestrator burns attempts and money going in
circles:

- **Retry** — the work never happened (a timeout, a missing binary). Same cell,
  once. Escalating it spends the top tier on a problem no model would solve.
- **More effort** — the work happened and was shallow: a missed edge case, a
  bug left behind, no verification. Same model, the next effort on the ladder.
- **Next model** — the work happened and was *wrong*: the approach was off, or
  two cells already gave the same answer. More thinking from the same model is a
  bet that is already settled; the next model enters at its own cell.
- **More turns** — the worker hit its turn ceiling. A ceiling is not a fault and
  does not clear on its own; it is raised once, then the task is split.
- **Replan** — the spec or the architecture is wrong. No model fixes a task that
  should not exist; the run stops and says so.
- **Review** — the work passed its own check and nothing is left to climb
  to; only the independent check's blockers stand. The work is kept for a
  person, never dropped as a failure.
- **Blocked** — a person has to act: the environment failed twice, or the
  worker was refused a command (a refusal is a setting, so retrying it, or
  sending a stronger model into it, gets the same refusal).

Deliberately absent from the inputs: the model's stated confidence. A model's
opinion of its own output is not evidence about the output.
